# Bingomatic
Copyright (c) 2019 Bart Massey

This is a work-in-progress Bingo Hall simulator. It plays
many simultaneous Bingo games and records "bingos" as row,
column or diagonal wins.

This project was inspired by a Reddit
[thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/agelwg/is_vecoptioni32_cachefriendly/ee6w7di/),
and written partly as a demo for my Systems Programming
[course](http://wiki.cs.pdx.edu/cs201-winter2019).

## Build and Run

This program requires successful installation of the
[`toyrand`](http://github.com/BartMassey/toyrand) PRNG.

You should be able to type `make` and get the `bingo`
executable.
